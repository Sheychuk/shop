## Folder Structure

The application is structured using the FSD (Feature-Structured Directory) architecture. The `src` directory is organized into the following folders:
shared — reusable functionality, detached from the specifics of the project/business.(e.g. UIKit, libs, API)\
entities — business entities.(e.g., User, Product, Order)\
features — user interactions, actions that bring business value to the user.(e.g. SendComment, AddToCart, UsersSearch)\
widgets — compositional layer to combine entities and features into meaningful blocks.(e.g. IssuesList, UserProfile)\
pages — compositional layer to construct full pages from entities, features and widgets.\
processes — complex inter-page scenarios. (e.g., authentication)\
app — app-wide settings, styles and providers.\
